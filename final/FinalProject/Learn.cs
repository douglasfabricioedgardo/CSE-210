It might be helpful to take a quick note of the way that you feel when you initially get this idea or impression.

Search the words of church leaders and authorities, the words of Prophets and Apostles, to find any example or support of it. If you didn't have enough time to study it out, set it aside for later, but if you've exhausted all efforts to find any support of it in the scriptures or in the words of church leaders and authorities, abandon it all together. Figure out if it fits more along the lines of a Pearl of knowledge, a simple task, a habit, or a mission. Compare it to the scriptures and words of the prophets. \n\n");

If it is a pearl of Knowledge, you need not make any plans for it, but have it in mind to review it and record it at some point. If it is a Task, Habit or Mission, ask for guidance in planning and acting on it. Tasks are one time events that usually have a date or time for it to be completed by. A Habit usually has a set pattern for how often you want it to be acheived and for how long. The goal of a habit is to force yourself for a certain period of time until it becomes a habit you do naturally anyways.At the end of the set time and date, even if you could improve on it and its not perfect, still continue on with it to the next steps. Missions are bigger Tasks that are a little more vague. Usually its hard to plan out a mission and needs the aid of creating sub tasks and habits in order to get there. Think about all you need to do to acheive your mission, then write down those things as tasks or habits. It might also be good to note which inspiration they came from if you have a way to keep track of them. Once you have those figured out pick a date that the whole mission will be completed and consider this inspiration planned for, you can plan out the sub tasks and habits later whenever you have time. This step is good to use a planner with, so that you can see how your missions and habits can trickle in down to even daily, and your tasks fit around them nicely. After a while of doing this, you will start to see your planner fill up every day.\n\n");

The reason you will start to see your planner filling up every day the more often you do this is because you are hearing Him more often! You are constantly filling yourself up with light as you act on the promptings and inspirations you receive. The Heavens rejoyce when you do so and the Lord will see fit to use you as a vesel to accomplish important work. Check your planner daily, the work of the Lord may fill it up, but He promises, that as you take His yoke upon yourself, you will have an increadable ability to do them with ease, as He says, His burdens are light.

Testify of Christ and share these experiences with others who may benefit from them. Promptings to share your testimony of eternal truths that you have learned from these things should be added as another inspiration received. But remember that by doing so, it is because of an inspiration from the Holy Ghost and should not be done because of a personal judgment about another person.
